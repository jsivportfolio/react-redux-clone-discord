    - Redux
        - is the data layer that wraps the entire application and all of its components
            - this data layer will have multiple slices
                - appSlice.js
                    - contains all of the generic information about the app
                - userSlice.js

BAD PRACTICES:
    - Excessive Prop-Drilling: 
        - passing props down through one component to another
